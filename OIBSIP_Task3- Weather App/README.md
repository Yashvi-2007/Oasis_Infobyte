# 🌦️ OIBSIP_python Task3- Weather App with JavaScript

🎯 Objective
Create a Python program that fetches and displays real-time weather information for a given location, offering users accurate and visually appealing weather updates.

📌 Project Description
The Basic Weather App is designed to provide up-to-date weather information using live data from a weather API. Users can search by city name (or automatically detect location, in the advanced version) to get temperature, humidity, wind speed, and general conditions. The app can be built as a simple command-line tool or as a fully interactive GUI application with weather icons, multiple unit options, and detailed forecasts.

✨ Key Features
• Fetches real-time weather data from a public weather API
• Displays essential weather details: temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions
• Supports unit conversion (Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit)
• Option for automatic location detection (advanced)
• User-friendly GUI with weather icons (advanced)
• Error handling for invalid locations or network issues
• Potential for extended forecasts (hourly/daily)

🛠 Technologies Used
• Language: Python
• Libraries: requests, json, tkinter (for GUI), geocoder (for location detection), Pillow (for icons)
• APIs: OpenWeatherMap API
• Tools: VS Code, Git

📊 Outcome
Successfully retrieves and displays weather information in a clear format. The GUI version enhances the user experience by including location auto-detection, icons, and multiple unit support, making it useful for both everyday users and travelers who need instant weather updates.
