# Oasis_Infobyte Internship Projects
This repository contains the projects I created during my OASIS INFOBYTE internship.  
These projects show my skills in creating functional Python programs, brainstorming ideas, debugging errors, and coming up with creative solutions.

## 📂 Projects Included

1️⃣ BMI Calculator

A Python program to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for height and weight, and display the corresponding health category.

Features:

- Accepts height (cm/m/feet/inch) and weight (kg) as inputs
- calculates BMI using the standard formula
- Classifies results (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese)
- Simple and easy-to-use
- View history (saved as csv) and charts
- [View Project](./OIBSIP_Task1_BMI_Calc)

2️⃣ Password Generator with Strength Checker
A tool that generates strong, random passwords and evaluates their strength.

Features:
- Customizable password length and character types (letters, numbers, symbols)
- Built-in strength meter (Weak, Medium, Strong)
- Option to copy the generated password to the clipboard
- Helps promote better password security practices
- Can also check the strength of the password you have created
- [View Project](./OIBSIP_Task2-Random_Password_Generator)

3️⃣ Weather App with Location Detection
A web-based application that shows real-time weather updates for any city entered.

Features:

- Fetches live weather data from OpenWeatherMap API
- Displays temperature & weather conditions
- Unit conversion toggle (Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit)
- Input validation and network error handling
- [View Project](./OIBSIP_Task3-Weather_App)

4️⃣ Daily Expense Tracker
A Python-based application to log, view, and analyse daily expenses.

Features:

- Add new expenses with category, description, and amount
- Summary of Today, This Week, and This Month’s expenses
- Visualisations:
  - 📊 Bar chart → Last 7 days’ spending
  - 🥧 Pie chart → Spending by categories
- Clear all expenses option with confirmation prompt
- Input validation and error handling for safe data entry
- [View Project](./OIBSIP_Task4-Expense_Tracker)
