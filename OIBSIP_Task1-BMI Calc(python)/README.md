# ðŸ§® OIBSIP_Python Task 1 BMI Calculator

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To create a Python program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a userâ€™s height and weight, and classifies it into health categories, with an easy-to-use interface and optional data tracking features.

## ðŸ“œ Project Description
This BMI Calculator allows users to:
- Input their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters, centimeters, or feet/inches).
- Automatically convert height into meters for accurate calculation.
- Compute BMI using the standard formula:
		BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m)Â²)
- Display the BMI value along with the health category (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese).
- Provide a simple, clean interface for quick usage.
- Optionally store and view past BMI results for personal tracking.

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- Accepts height in multiple formats (m, cm, feet/inches).
- User-friendly prompts and clear output formatting.
- Accurate classification based on WHO BMI ranges.
- Optional storage of BMI records for multiple entries.
- Error handling for invalid or unrealistic inputs.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Language: Python
- Libraries: tkinter (GUI), matplotlib (charts for history), csv (data storage)
- Tools: Visual Studio Code, Git, GitHub

## ðŸ“Š Outcome

- A functional BMI calculator suitable for both quick checks and long-term tracking.

- Demonstrates Python programming, data handling, and basic GUI development.
