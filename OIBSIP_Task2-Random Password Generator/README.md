# ðŸ”‘ OIBSIP_Python Task 2 - Random Password Generator

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Create a Python-based password generator that generates strong, customizable, and meaningful passwords to enhance security while ensuring they are easy to remember and use.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This Random Password Generator is created to help users create secure passwords that are both complex and practical. 
Instead of producing random, hard-to-type strings, it can generate passwords with a mix of random characters and meaningful word patterns for easier recall â€” without compromising strength. 
Users can define password length, choose character sets (letters, numbers, symbols), and instantly copy the generated password to the clipboard. 
The program also includes a strength checker to ensure the password meets high-security standards.

## 
âœ¨ Key Features

- Customizable Length: Generate passwords from 4 to 12 characters
- Character Type Selection: Choose from uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Batch Generation: Create 5 passwords at once for comparison
- Smart Character Distribution: Ensures at least one character from each selected type
- Smart randomization to avoid predictable patterns
- Password strength evaluation (Weak, Medium, Strong)
- Input validation to avoid invalid settings
-  Clipboard copy option for quick usage

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- Language: Python
-  Libraries: random, string, pyperclip, tkinter 

## ðŸ“Š Outcome

The project successfully generates passwords that has a balance between security and usability. By combining strong randomization with meaningful patterns, it creates passwords that are harder to crack yet easier to remember, making it ideal for personal and professional use.
